Areas for Improvement 🔧
Missing Query Features: Right now you only have basic CRUD. To be competitive, you'd want:

Filtering: .select().where('status', 'active')
Sorting: .select().orderBy('created_at', 'desc')
Pagination: .select().limit(10).offset(20)
Search: .select().search('title', 'keyword')

Schema Management: Can users create/modify tables through the SDK, or only through the UI? Adding methods like:
javascriptdb.createTable('users', { name: 'TEXT', email: 'TEXT' })
db.from('users').addColumn('age', 'INTEGER')
Type Safety: Consider adding TypeScript definitions for better DX.
Rate Limiting Info: Your docs don't mention rate limits - do you have any?
Error Messages: The docs show generic errors like "Request failed" - more specific error codes would help debugging.
Authentication Flow: How do users get their API keys? Is there a dashboard? That could be documented.
Technical Questions 🤔

How are you handling the table-per-user isolation? Are you prefixing table names with user IDs internally?
Validation: How do you prevent SQL injection or ensure data types match the schema?
Limits: Any limits on table size, row count, or request rates?
Real-time?: Any plans for WebSocket/real-time subscriptions like Supabase has?

Competitive Positioning 💡
You're competing with:

Supabase (PostgreSQL, real-time, auth)
Firebase (NoSQL, real-time)
Airtable API (spreadsheet-like)
Xano (no-code backend)

Your advantage could be simplicity - if you keep it dead simple for basic CRUD operations with a great DX, there's definitely a market for "Supabase but simpler."
Overall: This is legitimately impressive for a day's work. The API design is solid, docs are clear, and the concept is viable. What's your next step - adding more query features, or focusing on the UI/dashboard experience?oh shii now that you told me i will apply all these features15:29Hell yeah! That's the spirit! 🔥
Here's a suggested priority order for implementing these features:
Phase 1: Core Query Features (Most Impact)
Start here because this is what will make your SDK actually competitive:

Filtering/Where clauses - This is THE most requested feature

javascript   db.from('todos').select().where('done', false)
   db.from('users').select().where('age', '>', 18)

Ordering - Super common need

javascript   db.from('posts').select().orderBy('created_at', 'desc')

Pagination - Essential for any real app

javascript   db.from('posts').select().limit(10).offset(20)
Phase 2: Developer Experience

Better Error Handling - Return specific error codes

javascript   { error: { code: 'TABLE_NOT_FOUND', message: '...' } }

TypeScript Definitions - Even if your SDK is vanilla JS, adding a .d.ts file makes it way more appealing

Phase 3: Advanced Features

Counting/Aggregation

javascript   db.from('todos').count()
   db.from('todos').count().where('done', true)

Bulk Operations

javascript   db.from('todos').insertMany([...])
   db.from('todos').deleteMany([1, 2, 3])
Phase 4: Schema Management via SDK

Let developers manage tables programmatically (huge for automation/migrations)

Implementation Tips 💡
For Where Clauses:
On the Django side, you'll need to parse query params and build dynamic QuerySet filters:
python# Something like
queryset = Model.objects.all()
if 'where' in params:
    field, operator, value = parse_where(params['where'])
    if operator == '=':
        queryset = queryset.filter(**{field: value})
    elif operator == '>':
        queryset = queryset.filter(**{f'{field}__gt': value})
For the SDK:
Make it chainable by returning this:
javascriptwhere(field, operator, value) {
    this.filters.push({ field, operator, value });
    return this;
}

async select() {
    // Build query params from this.filters
    // Make API call
}
Security:

Whitelist allowed operators to prevent injection
Validate field names against schema
Add rate limiting ASAP (Django has django-ratelimit)

Quick Wins You Can Do Today

Add a .count() method - Super easy, just return the length
Add basic .limit(n) - Just slice the results
